**action** | **char \*** | Specifies the action taken on a pod failure when the requirements are satisfied. Possible values are:  - FailJob: indicates that the pod&#39;s job is marked as Failed and all   running pods are terminated. - FailIndex: indicates that the pod&#39;s index is marked as Failed and will   not be restarted. - Ignore: indicates that the counter towards the .backoffLimit is not   incremented and a replacement pod is created. - Count: indicates that the pod is handled in the default way - the   counter towards the .backoffLimit is incremented. Additional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should react to an unknown action by skipping the rule. |
